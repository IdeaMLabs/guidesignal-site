Fast hiring at [Company] - Quick replies guaranteed ⚡

EMAIL BODY:
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is growing fast and might need to fill roles quickly. 

We've built something different at GuideSignal - a hiring platform where employers pledge fast reply times and get a "Fast-Reply Certified" badge that attracts top talent.

**BADGE DEFINITION:** Fast-Reply Certified badge is awarded to employers who consistently respond to applications within their pledged timeframe, as verified by our system tracking.

Quick stats:
• Significantly faster than traditional platforms
• Pre-screened candidates with skill verification  
• Streamlined hiring process
• Featured jobs get 5x more applications
• Recent performance: 0% reply rate from 0 applications in last 24h

Would love to show you our current candidate pool - we have [specific roles relevant to their company] ready to interview.

Post your first job free: https://ideamlabs.github.io/guidesignal-site/post.html?utm_source=outreach&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=cohort_push
Feature it for just $25: https://ideamlabs.github.io/guidesignal-site/feature.html?utm_source=outreach&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=cohort_push

Best,
[Your Name]
GuideSignal

P.S. - We're launching with founding employers who get priority placement. Interested in being featured?

COLD CALL SCRIPT:
================

OPENING (15 seconds):
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from GuideSignal. I'm calling because I noticed [Company] has been posting a lot of job openings recently. Do you have 30 seconds for me to share how we're helping companies like yours fill roles in 3 days instead of 23?"

[Wait for response]

VALUE PROPOSITION (30 seconds):
"Great! So here's what makes us different - we require employers to pledge fast reply times, and in return, they get a 'Fast-Reply Certified' badge that top candidates love. Think of it like Amazon Prime for hiring.

Our data shows:
- Significantly faster placement than traditional platforms
- Pre-screened candidates with verified skills
- Streamlined hiring process with quick turnarounds

We currently have [X number] of pre-vetted [relevant role] candidates ready to interview."

CLOSE (15 seconds):
"I can get you set up with a free job posting in 2 minutes, or for $25 you can feature it for 5x more visibility. Which sounds better - starting with the free posting to test it out, or going straight to the featured option?"

[Handle response]

OBJECTION HANDLING:
===================

"We already use LinkedIn/Indeed"
→ "I understand - most of our clients did too. The difference is speed and commitment. Our Fast-Reply Certified system ensures candidates get quick responses, which leads to faster hiring cycles. Can I show you our current [relevant role] candidates?"

"We don't have budget"
→ "The free posting gives you everything - pre-screened candidates, our matching algorithm, and the fast-reply badge. The $25 feature option is just for 5x more visibility if you need to fill the role urgently. Want to start free?"

"We're not hiring right now"
→ "Perfect timing actually - you can browse our candidate pool at no cost and post when you're ready. Our best clients build relationships before they need to hire. Mind if I send you our candidate showcase?"

"I need to think about it"
→ "Absolutely. While you're considering it, can I send you our candidate pool for [relevant role]? No commitment, just so you can see the quality we attract. What's the best email?"

FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCES:
===================

DAY 2: "Hi [Name], following up on GuideSignal. Saw [Company news/update]. Our [relevant role] candidates are perfect for this growth phase. Still interested in the free posting?"

DAY 7: "Quick check-in on GuideSignal, [Name]. We just added 12 new pre-screened [relevant role] candidates this week. Worth a look?"

DAY 14: "Final follow-up, [Name]. If timing isn't right now, no worries. I'll check back in Q[next quarter]. In the meantime, here's our candidate showcase: [link]"
