ðŸ“‘ Agent Instructions

You have the file guidesignal_fixes_package.zip. Inside it are three items you need to use:

- style.css â†’ This is the global readability fix. Replace or merge it with the projectâ€™s main CSS file so that all text across the site follows the darker, more readable Mini1 style.
- auth_snippet.html â†’ This contains the corrected role selection code for the signup page (auth.html). Replace the current checkbox role section with this snippet so that users can only choose one role (Student, Job Seeker, or Recruiter).
- GuideSignal_Agent_Instructions_Checkboxes_Readability.pdf â†’ A reference guide with detailed explanations of both fixes.

Steps to follow:
1. Place style.css into the siteâ€™s CSS folder and ensure it is loaded globally.
2. Open auth.html and replace the existing role checkbox section with the code in auth_snippet.html.
3. Commit and push these changes to GitHub.
4. Verify on the live site that text is readable everywhere and that the signup page allows only one role choice.
