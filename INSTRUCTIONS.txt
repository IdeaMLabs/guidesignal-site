# INSTRUCTIONS for Agent â€” Button Validation Fix

This package includes `buttonValidationFix.js`, which ensures the Continue and Create Account buttons behave correctly.

## What the Agent Must Do

1. **Continue Button**
   - ID: `continue-btn`
   - Should be disabled by default.
   - Becomes active (blue, clickable) when any role radio button is selected (`name="role"`).

2. **Create Account Button**
   - ID: `create-account-btn`
   - Should be disabled by default.
   - Becomes active when ALL of the following are true:
     - A role is selected
     - Password and Confirm Password fields are filled (`id="signup-password"`, `id="signup-password-confirm"`) and match
     - Terms checkbox (`id="terms"`) is checked

3. **Visual States**
   - Disabled button: gray background, gray text, not clickable.
   - Active button: blue background, white text, clickable.

4. **How It Works**
   - `updateButtons()` checks the above conditions and updates button states accordingly.
   - Event listeners are attached to all input fields and the terms checkbox so the buttons update in real-time.

## End Result
- Users cannot proceed until conditions are met.
- Signup flow feels smooth and professional, preventing incomplete or invalid submissions.
