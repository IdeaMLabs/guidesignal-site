Agent, download and extract the `auth_fix_package_v5.zip`, then move the `unified-auth-v5.js` file into the projectâ€™s `assets/` directory and add a script reference at the very bottom of `auth.html` after all other scripts using <script src="assets/unified-auth-v5.js"></script>, remove any remaining legacy or commented validation code so that only this unified script manages validation and submission, and archive the old logic separately if you want to keep it for reference; next, ensure that inline styles in the role-specific templates are fully replaced with the new CSS classes defined in `shared.css` so that the markup is clean and maintainable, and confirm that password toggle buttons use the new fallback implementation with aria-labels for accessibility and proper keyboard/touch behavior, then run comprehensive testing in all scenarios: verify that signup and signin both work normally with external scripts loaded, continue to work in fallback mode if external scripts fail, validate correctly for Student, Job Seeker, and Recruiter roles using their prefixed IDs, display clear error and success messages that now differentiate between API errors and demo mode fallbacks, announce validation results properly to screen readers thanks to aria-live regions, and ensure that event listeners are firing only once via the new delegated event system; once testing passes, commit the changes to the repository knowing that the authentication system is now resilient, accessible, optimized, and production-ready.
